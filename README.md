# susceptibility-and-axon-morphology

_Our work on susceptibility combined with diffusion MRI reveals new insights into axon morphology._

This repository contains the code associated with our publication: Winther, S. et al. **Susceptibility-induced internal gradients reveal axon morphology and cause anisotropic effects in the diffusion-weighted MRI signal**. Sci Rep 14, 29636 (2024). [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-79043-5](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-79043-5).

The data presented in the publication is available for download [here](https://resources.drcmr.dk/MAPdata/susceptibility-and-axon-morphology-dataset/).

Under **notebooks**, you will find Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate both the _in vivo_ and _in silico_ analyses of the data.

Under **production**, you will find scripts for generating new data.
